LAB: Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## Problem Domain
- Objects and Classes
In the objects folder, there is a full implementation of a Car and Motorcycle object created using a constructor function, with an index.js file that you can use to visually play with the objects as well as tests.

In the objects/__tests__ folder, youâ€™ll find a file called vehicle.test.js that tests the implementation of both a Car and a Motorcycle using the constructor pattern.
